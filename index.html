It was also designed to serve as the primary propulsion and maneuvering system of the spacecraft.

      <h3>What Went Wrong</h3>

        <img src=http://www.delange.org/New_Mexico_Museum_of_Space_History/Apollo_Fuel_Cell.jpg>

        <p>An investigation into what went wrong with Apollo 13 found that a heating wire inside the liquid oxygen tank had lost its insulation, which led to the explosion. The cause was a combination of mistakes in design, testing, and implementation. Apollo 13 carried an oxygen tank with a troubled history. The tank had been damaged in testing, but the spacecraft builders were not aware of a problem. The cylindrical service module had six pie-slice sectors. Sectors 2, 3, 5 and 6 held the main fuel tanks. Sector 4 held the damaged oxygen tank<a href="p.html">.</a></p>

        <h3>How The Crew Survived</h3>

        <img src=http://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/timeline.jpg>

        <p>Click <a href=http://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/timeline.jpg>HERE</a> for a bigger picture. On April 11, 1970, NASA launched the Apollo 13 mission to send three astronauts to the moon and mark the third manned lunar landing. The mission aimed to send commander Jim Lovell and lunar module pilot Fred Haise to the lunar surface, while command module pilot Jack Swigert remained in orbit. But on April 13, the mission suffered a crippling explosion that would nearly doom the spaceflight and its crew. 

What really saved the apollo 13 crew is the lunar module. Since the crew had not laned on the moon they still had the power and oxygen of the lunar module. The problem is that the lunar module had a triangle dock to load and get the oxygen but the spacecraft had a square dock to load and get the oxygen. The crew had to build a converter to use the oxygen and power. One last object to bost the chance to get back is to turn off all the nonvidle systems inculding the heat. In the spaceship it was not idlea living.</p>

      <h3>What Nasa changed</h3>

        <img src=http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/gallery/images/apollo/apollo14/hires/s71-16745.jpg>

        <p>click <a href= http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/gallery/images/apollo/apollo14/hires/s71-16745.jpg >HERE</a> to see a bigger picture of the oxygen tank. After the mess up with apollo 13 Nasa made some changes. One change they made is removing two fans in the  oxygen tanks. Put some more sensor in the tank. One of the sensors that got added was a heat sensor.</p>
